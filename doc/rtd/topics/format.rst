=========
Formats
=========

User data that will be acted upon by cloud-init must be in one of the following types.

Gzip Compressed Content
------------------------

Content found to be gzip compressed will be uncompressed.
The uncompressed data will then be used as if it were not compressed. 
This is typically is useful because user-data is limited to ~16384 [#]_ bytes.

Mime Multi Part Archive
------------------------

This list of rules is applied to each part of this multi-part file. 
Using a mime-multi part file, the user can specify more than one type of data.

For example, both a user data script and a cloud-config type could be specified.

Supported content-types:

- text/x-include-once-url
- text/x-include-url
- text/cloud-config-archive
- text/upstart-job
- text/cloud-config
- text/part-handler
- text/x-shellscript
- text/cloud-boothook

Helper script to generate mime messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/python
   
   import sys
   
   from email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart
   from email.mime.text import MIMEText
   
   if len(sys.argv) == 1:
       print("%s input-file:type ..." % (sys.argv[0]))
       sys.exit(1)
   
   combined_message = MIMEMultipart()
   for i in sys.argv[1:]:
       (filename, format_type) = i.split(":", 1)
       with open(filename) as fh:
           contents = fh.read()
       sub_message = MIMEText(contents, format_type, sys.getdefaultencoding())
       sub_message.add_header('Content-Disposition', 'attachment; filename="%s"' % (filename))
       combined_message.attach(sub_message)
   
   print(combined_message)


User-Data Script
------------------------

Typically used by those who just want to execute a shell script.

Begins with: ``#!`` or ``Content-Type: text/x-shellscript`` when using a MIME archive.

Example
~~~~~~~

::

  $ cat myscript.sh
  
  #!/bin/sh
  echo "Hello World.  The time is now $(date -R)!" | tee /root/output.txt
  
  $ euca-run-instances --key mykey --user-data-file myscript.sh ami-a07d95c9 

Include File
------------

This content is a ``include`` file.

The file contains a list of urls, one per line.
Each of the URLs will be read, and their content will be passed through this same set of rules.
Ie, the content read from the URL can be gzipped, mime-multi-part, or plain text.

Begins with: ``#include`` or ``Content-Type: text/x-include-url``  when using a MIME archive.

Cloud Config Data
-----------------

Cloud-config is the simplest way to accomplish some things
via user-data. Using cloud-config syntax, the user can specify certain things in a human friendly format. 

These things include:

- apt upgrade should be run on first boot
- a different apt mirror should be used
- additional apt sources should be added
- certain ssh keys should be imported
- *and many more...*

**Note:** The file must be valid yaml syntax.

See the :ref:`yaml_examples` section for a commented set of examples of supported cloud config formats.

Begins with: ``#cloud-config`` or ``Content-Type: text/cloud-config`` when using a MIME archive.

Upstart Job
-----------

Content is placed into a file in ``/etc/init``, and will be consumed by upstart as any other upstart job.

Begins with: ``#upstart-job`` or ``Content-Type: text/upstart-job`` when using a MIME archive.

Cloud Boothook
--------------

This content is ``boothook`` data. It is stored in a file under ``/var/lib/cloud`` and then executed immediately.
This is the earliest ``hook`` available. Note, that there is no mechanism provided for running only once. The boothook must take care of this itself.
It is provided with the instance id in the environment variable ``INSTANCE_I``. This could be made use of to provide a 'once-per-instance' type of functionality.

Begins with: ``#cloud-boothook`` or ``Content-Type: text/cloud-boothook`` when using a MIME archive.

Part Handler
------------

This is a ``part-handler``. It will be written to a file in ``/var/lib/cloud/data`` based on its filename (which is generated).
This must be python code that contains a ``list_types`` method and a ``handle_type`` method. 
Once the section is read the ``list_types`` method will be called. It must return a list of mime-types that this part-handler handles.

The ``handle_type`` method must be like:

.. code-block:: python

    def handle_part(data, ctype, filename, payload):
      # data = the cloudinit object
      # ctype = "__begin__", "__end__", or the mime-type of the part that is being handled.
      # filename = the filename of the part (or a generated filename if none is present in mime data)
      # payload = the parts' content

Cloud-init will then call the ``handle_type`` method once at begin, once per part received, and once at end.
The ``begin`` and ``end`` calls are to allow the part handler to do initialization or teardown.

Begins with: ``#part-handler`` or ``Content-Type: text/part-handler`` when using a MIME archive.
